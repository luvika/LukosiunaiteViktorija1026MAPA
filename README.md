# LukosiunaiteViktorija1026MAPA

Karo Espacial
1026mapa flying shooting game

This project was created for University purposes. Our group was challenged to make a game using many sources (blender, processing, arduino) and asked to upload everything into Github.

Using this code is easy, simply copy and paste everything onto processing, and also don't forget to drag all the files, images and sounds if you want it to work as the original.

The only exeption is the "serial" file that's exclusive for who has arduino. That's the code that we used to make our game external. You can just ignore it if you don't want it.
